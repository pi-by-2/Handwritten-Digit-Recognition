The project is based on the famous MNIST Dataset. SVM (Support Vector Machine), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are used to train the dataset and predict the labels (digits from 0-9). PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used as a dimensionality reduction method to visualize the data as well as observe the performance of the models after applying it. Confusion Matrix, Accuracy (Training and Validation) and Training time are noted for each model. Various graphs are also plotted for the purpose of model evaluation. A summarized project report is also included in the repository. Suggestions and feedback are highly appreciated!
